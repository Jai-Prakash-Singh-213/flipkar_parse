The Lacquer ear rings is graced with ethnic heartshape design and shining gems for an elegant appeal to your personality. Adorn this beautiful Jewellery creation to give yourself a graceful look. These vibrant ear rings are traditionally designed and handcrafted. They are richly made and display a fine shine. Each piece of jewellery has been painstakingly individually handcrafted with utmost care and skill. The ear rings pair is packed in a jewellery box. The jewellery is embellished with matching beads in ethnic design. Lacquer is a clear or coloured varnish, that dries by solvent evaporation and can be further polished as required.

The individually prepared plaques are joined together to form a necklace or are used singly in the form of pendants and ear rings. The jewellery takes its final shape when coordinated with multi coloured beads. The final product looks very glamorous, with engraved designs as the motifs.

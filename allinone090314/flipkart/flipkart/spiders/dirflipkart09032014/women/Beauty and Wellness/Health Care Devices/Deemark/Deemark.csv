It Is Operating Most Effectively At Temperatures Of Between 43C (110F) And 46C (116F) And A Relative Humidity Above 100%. In A Steam Bath  Steam (Or To Be More Scientifically Correct  MIST) Should Be Permanently Present. This Requires An Efficient Steam Generator  A Precise Control System And A Steam-Tight Cabin To Prevent Steam Escaping And Damaging The Fabric Of The Surrounding Room. Between 1983 And 1986  At The University Of Munichs Institute Of Medical Balneology And Climatology A Comprehensive Series Of Comparative Tests Were Conducted To Determine The Effects Of The Sauna  HOME SPA and Whirlpool Bath On The Human Body In View Of A Considerable Uncertainty Which Had Previously Surrounded The Steam Bath. Steam Baths Should Not Be Recommended Or Prescribed To Clients With Known Cardiac Pathology. Steam Baths Are Recommended Wherever Generalized Moist Heat Applications Are Indicated. Physical Agents Act Directly With A Physical Effect; That Is  Radiant Energy Becomes Heat When Absorbed By Living Cells. Physical Agents May In Addition Indirectly Influence The Autonomic And Endocrine Systems As Well As The Electrolyte Balance. The Biologic Response To The ""Push"" Of Physical Stimulation Of The Vegetative Hormonal System Is An Adaptive Reaction To Stress  Which Involves The Adrenal Cortex And Increases Blood Steroids. In Fact  The Interrelationship Between Adrenal And Blood Steroids May Be An Important Factor In The Hit-And-Miss Success Of This Form Of Hydrotherapy. If So  The Intensity (Or Dose) Of Physical Stimulation Will Determine The ""Stress"" Of This Hydrotherapy Program.TEMPERATURE IS CRITICAL PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS - The Body Tries To Increase Its Heat Loss Through All Possible Avenues-Especially The Skin And Lungs. If The Environmental Temperature Exceeds That Of The Body  The Only Way To Lose Heat Is Through Sweating. The Body Cannot Maintain A Constant Temperature When The Environmental Temperature Is High As That Reached In A HOME Spa or Sauna  And So The Body Temperature Begins To Rise. As The Coetaneous Circulation Increases  Heat Is Accepted More Readily By The Body From The Environment. A Reduced Skin Circulation Would Reduce The Rise Of Body Temperature  But This Is Not Possible. The Rise In Body Temperature Depends Mainly On - The Temperature And Humidity Content Of The Steam Bath  The Sweating Capability Of The Bather  And The Bathing Time. Body Temperatures Have Been Found To Range From 37.6C (99.6F) To 40C (104F). Thus  The Physiologic Changes That Occur During The Bath Are Due In Part To The Rise In Body Temperature And In Part To The Influence Of The Reflexes Of The Hormonal And Nervous Systems  Which Attempt To Increase The Heat Loss. The Research Results Revealed That  Given The Correct Choice Of Temperature And Duration  A HOME SPA Produces The Same Thermal Effect On The Body As A Sauna And Is Equally Beneficial. This Is Due To The Fact That The Saturated Level Of Humidity In A HOME Spa is Markedly Counter-Balanced By Lower Temperatures Than In A Sauna. The Enjoyment And Benefits That The HOME Spa affords Thus Depend Critically On The Correct Temperature Being Set And Maintained. In A Steam Bath  The Optimum Temperature Lies Within A Narrow 43-46C (110-116F) Range. These Temperatures Are Not Only Experienced As The Most Pleasant  They Are Also The Most Beneficial. If The Maximum Temperature Is Exceeded By As Little As 2-3C  The Atmosphere Is Felt To Be Too Hot. Proper HOME Spa control Systems Prevent Such A Temperature Rise And Maintain The Optimum Conditions With The Utmost Reliability  Regulating The Temperature  The Supply And Density Of The Steam  The Intake Of Fresh Air And The Extraction Of Spent Air Entirely Automatically.        </div> <div style="clear: both;"></div> </div>,<div class="item_left_column" id="specifications"> <h3 class="item_desc_title fk-uppercase">         Specifications of Deemark DHS Home Spa Massager (Pink)    </h3> <table cellspacing="0" class="fk-specs-type2"> <tr> <th class="group-head" colspan="2">In The Box</th> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Sales Package</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Massager</td> </tr> </table> <table cellspacing="0" class="fk-specs-type2"> <tr> <th class="group-head" colspan="2">Product Details</th> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Type</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Body</td> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Model Name</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Home Spa</td> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Color</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Pink</td> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Model Id</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">DHS</td> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Brand</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Deemark</td> </tr> </table> <table cellspacing="0" class="fk-specs-type2"> <tr> <th class="group-head" colspan="2">Power Requirements</th> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Power Source</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">Electricty</td> </tr> <tr class=""> <td class="specs-key">Power Required (Volts)</td> <td class="specs-value fk-data">220 - 240 V</td> </tr> </table> </div>,10:03:2014,None

Description - The biggest challenge when it comes to kids oral care habits is the rush to brush. Two minutes ? one minute on the upper row and one minute on the lower row - is the recommended time it takes to properly brush. However, kids will most often give their teeth a few ineffective scrubs, spit and thats it. Firefly, a bright and sparkly childrens toothbrush that lights up and flashes for one minute, inspires kids to brush longer. The flashing toothbrush encourages kids to brush more thoroughly than regular toothbrushes and it is the best-selling kids toothbrush in the U.S. Getting kids to brush and brush for the right amount of time is one of the biggest headaches for parents. But parents can now breathe easy, as Kids Comply With Firefly. How to use - Take your Firefly toothbrush and apply a small pea size amount of toothpaste on it as usual. Push the base of the toothbrush up, the light inside the brush handle will start blinking. Brush the lower row of teeth till the lighting stops, lighting stops after 60 seconds (the dentist recommended time for brushing one row of teeth). Push the base of the brush up again, it starts lighting up again. Brush the upper row of teeth till the lighting stops. Phew You are done - now take a look at those pearly white teeth and smile. And someday, dont forget to try it in disco mode with lights off.        </div>\n        <div style="clear: both;"></div>\n            </div>'], 'spec': [u'<div id="specifications" class="item_left_column">\n    <h3 class="item_desc_title fk-uppercase">\n        Specifications of Firefly Baby Toothbrush (White)    </h3>\n\n            <table cellspacing="0" class="fk-specs-type2"><tr><th class="group-head" colspan="2">In the Box</th>\n            </tr><tr class=""><td class="specs-key">Sales Package</td>\n                                        <td class="specs-value fk-data">Toothbrush</td>\n                </tr></table><table cellspacing="0" class="fk-specs-type2"><tr><th class="group-head" colspan="2">Body Features</th>\n            </tr><tr class=""><td class="specs-key">Head Type</td>\n                                        <td class="specs-value fk-data"

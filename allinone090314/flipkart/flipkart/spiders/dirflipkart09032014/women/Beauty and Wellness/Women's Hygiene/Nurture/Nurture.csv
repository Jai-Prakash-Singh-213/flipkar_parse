Experiments show that silver ion is capable of eliminating 99.9% of bacteria exposed in no more than 1 hr. Since the working woman of today has very little time to change pads during the day silver ion eliminates the bacteria and other pathogens that develop due to moisture. In addition silver is body temperature adjusting and anti-static which would promote good circulation and comfort.

These hypoallergenic pads are irritation free because of the breathable qualities of 100% cotton. That means no more itching  even for those with sensitive skin.

This makes these sanitary napkins dioxin free  keeping away known carcinogens from our most intimate body parts.
